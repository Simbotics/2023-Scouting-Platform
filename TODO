TODO LiSt
This is a list of all TODO items ranging from most important all the way to least important. This is in no specific order and not everything is final until proven final. Take everything with a grain of salt as there will be a review and testing session for each alpha release. There will be a separate document/file which withholds extra information on each of these features.

DATAFLOW
At the moment, things are a little wacky although it does work. You generate a QR code with the scouting tablet then get it scanned by a "master tablet". Once it's scanned it will generate a new spreadsheet file on the scanning tablet. The scouting tablet that had the QR code scanned will then have to manually reset all of the fields. An example of the compared data flows including the new one is down below. (these work with bluetooth but I'm still working on it)

Old (current):
scouting tablet QR code data -> scanned by master tablet -> data is saved to a new CSV file on the scanning device.

New (unconfirmed) {1}:
scouting tablet data -> sent to arduino over bluetooth -> data is send to the master tablet from the arduino over bluetooth to be saved into one CSV file -> data is also sent over radio waves to another arduino in the pits where the data is then synced over bluetooth to a tablet there

New (unconfirmed) {2}:
scouting tablet data -> send to the master tablet over bluetooth -> master tablet saves data into main CSV file

MASTER TABLET/SCOUTING TABLET FEATURES

    ALREADY HERE
- When QR code is scanned, add the scanned data to an existing CSV file. If it doesn't exist, create it; If it does, go down a new line and add the contents.
- Rapid fire scanning (don't go to home screen, create new instance of the camera then swap to page).
- When the reset all fields is pressed, reset all fields but match number and initials and increment initials.
- Scouting tablet button to increase brightness for scanning and a button to decrease it. (update QR code button?)
- 

    NOT IMPORTANT (ALREADY HERE)
- Customizability
    - Custom background/background color (sync with alliance colour as well).
- Word censoring.

    QR CODE RELATED
- Match schedule importing
- Show table which contains the teams scanned for each match.
- QR code scouting tablets can scan to import the teams they need to scout.
- Encode comments with base64 to remove variability in QR complexity.


    SOON TO COME
- Bluetooth data transfer. (only data contained in QR code for now)
    - Midigate QR codes for transfering data.
- Separate scanning app to remove complexity and taylor the experience.

    NOT IMPORTANT (SOON TO COME)
- Add borders to fields.
- Make hitboxes bigger for counter input field to read more inputs.

- Virtual SimCredit system. (after bluetooth)
- Maybe some small games? (chess, tetris, custom simbotics game?, etc)

    BACK-END ORGANIZATION
- Organize files to their correct directories
- Rename files to a better name
- Remove classes that don't need to be in the app (reduce app size)
- Git ignore files/classes that have important/useful methods (DON'T DELETE)
